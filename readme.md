jna-mousey
==========

About
-----
This is my project space for learning to use JNA (Java Native Access) to leverage Raw Input (low-level Windows messages) to be able to distinguish input from different/multiple mice plugged into the PC, as part of an effort to add local multiplayer support to the awesome [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon)

Building
--------
Built with JDK 1.8.0_231
Do `./gradlew run` to compile and run the project.
Source is squirrelled away in `src\main\java\hello` because java and gradle conventions are crazy-in-love with deep nested folders.
